This project's goal is to create a BrowserPlus[1] plugin to profile Javascript.

Service Description:

A service that analyzes the memory and cpu usage of a web browser. The service can take 1 sample or multiple samples at a specified
interval. When sampling at intervals, at most 1,000 samples are taken. If you provide a callback function, your javascript will be called
after every sample is taken. If no callback is provided, all samples are stored in an array and returned after start() completes or stop()
is called.

Right now it's a hack, no, a kludge that's brittle, ugly and smells bad.
It's osx only.

How to get the service installed:

    cd src/native_service/
    make

Now visit the html files under the tests directory
